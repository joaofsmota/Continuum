# $\large \mathrm{Overview}$
The main purpose of the Crimson Rapids Engine is to apply the algorithms outlined in the research papers [accessible here](https://cescg.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Michelic-Real-Time-Rendering-of-Procedurally-Generated-Planets-2.pdf) to generate functional simulations of planetary surfaces, oceans, and atmospheric conditions. While prioritizing functionality over absolute realism, the engine aims to provide a compelling and immersive experience for players of space simulation games. It enables seamless transitions between space, atmosphere, and surface environments, allowing players to explore and interact with diverse planetary elements within the game world.
