# $\large \mathrm{Overview}$
The Continuum engine is dedicated to implementing the algorithms outlined in the research papers ([accessible here](https://cescg.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Michelic-Real-Time-Rendering-of-Procedurally-Generated-Planets-2.pdf)) for real-time rendering and procedural generation of planetary surfaces, oceans, and atmospheric conditions. It places a strong emphasis on game-oriented functionalities and features that enable seamless transitions between complex environments, from buildings to cities to atmospheric phenomena and beyond, in order to create a truly immersive experience for players.
