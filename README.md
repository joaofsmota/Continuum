# $\large \mathrm{Overview}$
The Vanished Engine aims to integrate the algorithms outlined in the research papers [accessible here](https://cescg.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Michelic-Real-Time-Rendering-of-Procedurally-Generated-Planets-2.pdf) to generate functional simulations of planetary surfaces, oceans, and atmospheric conditions. It prioritizes functionality over absolute realism to provide an immersive experience for players of space simulation games. The engine enables seamless transitions between space, atmosphere, and surface environments, allowing players to explore and interact with diverse planetary elements within the game world.
